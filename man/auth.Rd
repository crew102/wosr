\usage{
auth(username = Sys.getenv("WOS_USERNAME"),
  password = Sys.getenv("WOS_PASSWORD"))
}
\arguments{
\item{username}{Your username. Specify \code{username = NULL} if you want to
use IP-based authentication.}

\item{password}{Your password. Specify \code{password = NULL} if you want to
use IP-based authentication.}
}
\value{
A session ID
}
\description{
\code{auth} asks the API's server for a session ID (SID), which you can then
pass along to either \code{\link{query_wos}} or \code{\link{pull_wos}}. Note,
there are limits on how many session IDs you can get in a given period of time
(roughly 5 SIDs in a 5 minute period).

\examples{
\dontrun{

# Pass user credentials in manually:
auth("some_username", password = "some_password")

# Use the default of looking for username and password in envvars, so you
# don't have to keep specifying them in your code:
Sys.setenv(WOS_USERNAME = "some_username", WOS_PASSWORD = "some_password")
auth()
}
}
